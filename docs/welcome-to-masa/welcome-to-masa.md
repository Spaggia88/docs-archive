## Masa Protocol
### Node Setup
Learn how to set up a Masa node in your environment ready for configuration and deployment:
- [Binary Installation](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-binary-installation.md)
- [Docker Setup](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-docker-setup.md)
- [Digital Ocean Setup](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-digital-ocean-setup.md)

### Node Staking
- [Staking Your Node](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-staking-guide.md)

:::danger

All protocol nodes need to stake test MASA on Sepolia, this requires **Sepolia ETH**.

## Node Configuration
### Set Up a Data Scraper (Worker Node)
If you want your node to earn rewards configure it to to scrape data on the Masa Protocol.

- [Twitter Scraper](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-twitter-scraper-config.md)
- [Web Scraper](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-web-scraper-config.md)
- [Discord Scraper](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-discord-scraper-config.md)
- [Telegram Scraper](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-telegram-scraper-setup.md)

:::info

You need to have **setup** your node and **staked** your node first to be able to scrape data:

### Get data from the Network (Developer Node)
AI developers can get data from the Masa Protocol for free by running a Masa node locally or by using our API (**coming soon**).

- [Staking Your Node](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-staking-guide.md)
- [Developer Configuration](/docs/masa-protocol/protocol-developer-config.md)

:::info

To get data from the Masa Protocol as a developer you need to stake your node (no free leech) - **you need Sepolia ETH** to stake.
